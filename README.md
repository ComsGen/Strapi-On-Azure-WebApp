# Strapi On Azure Windows Web App

## Get started
This repo is a customoziation of the code generated by the Strapi CLI to make it works on Azure Windows WebApp. To reproduce this repo by your own:
1. npm create-strapi-app my-project --quickstart
2. In the folder `my-project` add the 2 files:
      - `server.js` this file is needed because the Windows Web App needs a js file as an entry point.
      - `web.config` this file is use by iisnode which is the bridge between Windows IIS and Node js.
3. Edit the `package.json` file replace the start script `strapi start` by `node server.js`

### server.js file
This file replace the CLI `strapi start`:
```js 
'use strict';
const strapi = require('./node_modules/strapi/lib/index')

strapi().start();
```
### Web.config file

This file is almost the default one generated automaticaly by Azure on a Git deploy. You notice that it refers to the `server.js`file. The difference with the default one is the security section:
```xml    
<security>
  <requestFiltering>
    <hiddenSegments>
      <remove segment="build"/>
    </hiddenSegments>
  </requestFiltering>
</security>
```
This section allows to access to the `build` folder which contains the Admin panel

## Deploy on Azure
1. Create a Windows Web App
2. In `Application Settings` add the variables (or import the `.env` file): 
    - `NODE_ENV=PRODUCTION` for starting Strapi with the `Production` configuration
    - `WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION=10.14.1`
    - `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE=0`
3. Update the settings in `./config/environments/production/server.json` accordingly. Set `"port": "${process.env.PORT || 1337}"`.
4. (Only in the context of this repo) Create a CosmosDB instance with a MongoDB Api
    - In the `Preview features`, enbale `Aggregation Pipeline`
5. Update the settings in `./config/environments/production/database.json` accordingly
5. Set local variable `set NODE_ENV=PRODUCTION`
6. Build the Admin Panel. 
6. Deploy the app with the Zip Deploy (here from VSCode with the [Azure App Service Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice))
7. Browse to your App. It could take a while for the first start. Could even end up with an error. Reload the page.

## Last point....
Don't run  `npm i`, use `yarn` instead to be sure to get the right version package
